4.3 Remote Access Scenario
Aside from providing host-based authentication for local
access, MDA techniques could also potentially be employed
in remote access scenarios, such as web-based applications.
To properly evaluate their eectiveness in this scenario, we
must consider the fact that, in practice, a given user may
access a single web-based application from multiple computers. This could lead to the situation in which the enrollment
data for a user is collected under a dierent computing environment than the data used for verication. Thus, to be
eective in this scenario, the authentication system must
be capable of recognizing a user's behavior across dierent computing environments. To the best of our knowledge,
the eectiveness of mouse dynamics based authentication
has not been evaluated under this scenario in the existing
literature.
